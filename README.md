### Hi, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer based in Birmingham.

I was working in scientific publishing in Production and Product roles until I realised I was destined for a career in Tech. Having recently completed the School of Code Bootcamp, I'm now looking to realise my dream of becoming a full-time software developer. 

Please say hello! ðŸ™‚
